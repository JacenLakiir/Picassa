README: Picassa Code Complete 3
===============================

Name: Eric Mercer (ewm10)

Started:  2/6/12
Finished: 2/6/12

Project Length:
- 2 hours [Actual]
- 2 hours [Estimated]

Estimate evaluation:
- My estimate was spot-on. The infinite expressions and conditional expression were implemented very quickly while modifying the regex for ParenExpression in order to accept the alternate symbolic function names took a while, as did merging and implementing the animation feature from the given snarf file.

Discussed with:
- no one

Resources:
- none 

Files Used to Start and Test:
- Picassa Design 2
- spring12_cps108_02_picassa_animated (animation example)
- tested with ParserTest

Data / Resource Files Required:
- none

Impressions:

My design improvements for Design 2 came in handy for this last round of feature additions. Implementation was fairly straightforward and my open-ended design for number of operands proved useful for quickly adding infinite expressions. While adding the animation feature, I also had the opportunity to clean up and simplify some repetitive/redundant code in VariableExpression, something I missed in my previous submission due to Part 2's singular focus on adding new ParenExpressions.
